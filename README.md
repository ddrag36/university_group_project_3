This project focuses on clustering text data from movie reviews in the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) to uncover patterns and sentiments in the reviews. The dataset consists of 5000 reviews, each with a sentiment label indicating whether the review is positive or negative. The task involved multiple preprocessing steps to clean the text data, including converting the text to lowercase, removing stopwords and punctuation, and creating a Document-Term Matrix (DTM) for further analysis. Various clustering methods were applied, including K-Means, K-Medians, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Hierarchical Clustering, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). After evaluating these models using metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, the GMM model was selected as the best performing due to its higher Silhouette Score, indicating better-defined and cohesive clusters. The final report communicates the results and insights from the clustering analysis.
